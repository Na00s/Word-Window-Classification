# Word-Window-Classification
Implementing a word window classifier with PyTorch to find the location word in a sentence.

We recreate an attention mechanism to perform this task by looking at the surrounding of a word when making a prediction about if that word is a location or not.

The dataset is small and hand made, the objectif is to focus on the modelization.
